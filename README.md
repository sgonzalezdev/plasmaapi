# PlasmaAPI

### PlasmaAPI is a simple fast and reliable web library API built with Python 3.10+ and using Django 4.0+ 

## Why should I use this API? 

1. **Fast:** This library or Django (App) is using all the power of Django 4.0 by allowing high performance and use of the framework properties. Note this has been tested 100% with Axious using JavaScript   
2. **Easy to code:** Neat documentation that saves you time while integrating the source to your projects. It is as simple as adding the app (email_api) to seetings.py 
3. **Short:** Avoiding complex functions, easy, fast and well-documented reducing bugs and allowing scalability
